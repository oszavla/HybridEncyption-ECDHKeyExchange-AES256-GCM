# HybridEncyption-ECDHKeyExchange-AES256-GCM
A hybrid encryption scheme is a cryptographic technique that combines the speed of symmetric encryption (using AES-256-GCM) with the secure key distribution of asymmetric encryption (using ECDH). 

This repository is for enrichment courses final project (Cryptography) in odd semester at Information Technology, Faculty of Intelligent Electrical and Information technology, Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology.
